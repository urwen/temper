# temper.py

The USB temperature and temperature/humidity sensors sold by PCsensor are
widely available from the parent site
(http://pcsensor.com/usb-temperature-humidity.html), from Amazon, and from
EBay.

## Design

There are several open source software projects that support these sensors,
sometimes including complicated monitoring and graphing software. Unlike,
these projects, the goal of this project is to simply read data from the
sensors and do nothing else, given the following constraints:
* must work under Linux,
* must work with Python 3,
* third-party software will be avoided when possible,
* all third-party software must be provided as standard Debian packages.

### libusb is not used

I tried to use libusb (apt-get install python3-usb; "import usb.core") and it
provides a sophisticated interface to USB devices that was very nice.
Unfortunately, I have one thermometer that didn't work with raw usb and that
required access via the hidraw device; and I have another thermometer that has
an undocumented HID protocol, but that is accessible via a serial tty.

### hid and hidapi are not used

I tried using hid (apt-get install python3-hid) and hidapi (apt-get install
python3-hidapi) and these worked ok for two of the thermometers I have, but
not for the one that requires access via a serial tty.

### pySerial is used

Although HID devices are accessed directly, pySerial is used for TTYs. This
module is available as a Debian package:
  sudo apt-get install python3-serial

## Supported Devices

I own five kinds of devices from PCsensors. These are all supported by
temper.py.

In the following table "I" means the sensor is internal to the USB stick and
"E" means the sensor is on a cable that is plugged into the USB stick.

Product    |    Id     |  Firmware       | Temp | Hum | Notes
-----------|-----------|-----------------|------|-----|---------------
TEMPer     | 0c45:7401 | TEMPer1F_V1.3r1F| E    |     | Metal
TEMPer     | 0c45:7401 | TEMPerF1.4      | I    |     | Metal
TEMPer     | 413d:2107 | TEMPerGold_V3.1 | I    |     | Metal
TEMPerHUM  | 413d:2107 | TEMPerX_V3.1    | I    | I   | White plastic
TEMPer2    | 413d:2107 | TEMPerX_V3.3    | I,E  |     | White plastic
TEMPer1F   | 413d:2107 | TEMPerX_V3.3    | E    |     | White plastic
TEMPerX232 | 1a86:5523 | TEMPerX232_V2.0 | I,E  | I   | White plastic

The 1a86:5523 device may identify as 413d:2107 depending on button presses,
but it cannot be used successfully when in that mode.

If you try other software that uses libusb, the hidraw device may be
disconnected. In this case, remove and re-insert the USB stick.

The TEMPer1F has only an external sensor, but it is not possible to detect
that it is external, so it is reported as an internal temperature.

### TEMPer

This is a metal USB stick marked "TEMPer" with thermometer logo on one side,
and "TEMPer" on the other side. The end opposite the USB connector has a screw
hole. There is *no* humidity detector, but it appears water proof and I have
submerged mine momentarily in ice water and in boiling water.

### TEMPerHUM

This is a white plastic USB stick marked "TEMPerHUM", "-40C - +85C", and
"0-100%RH"; with *blue button* marked "TXT". On the reverse, "PCsensor". This
model does *not* have a jack on the end.

When the button is pressed the red LED will blink as messages of the following
style are sent (the temperature line repeats every second).

```
www.pcsensor.com
temperx v3.1
caps lock:on/off/++
num lock:off/on/--
type:inner-h2
inner-temperinner-humidityinterval
32.73 [c]36.82 [%rh]1s
```
When the button is pressed again, the LED will either be off or be solid red.
This is the mode that temper.py uses.

### TEMPer2

physical description: White plastic USB stick marked "TEMPer2",
"-40C - +125C"; with red button marked "TXT". On the reverse, "PCsensor".
This model has a jack for an external sensor on the end.

notes: When the button is pressed, the red LED will blink as messages
of the following form are sent (the temperature line repeats every
second).

Without an external sensor:
```
www.pcsensor.com
temperx v3.3
caps lock:on/off/++
num lock:off/on/--
type:inner-tx
inner-tempinterval
27.93 [c]1s
```

With an external sensor:
```
www.pcsensor.com
temperx v3.3
caps lock:on/off/++
num lock:off/on/--
type:inner-tx;outer-tx
inner-tempintervalinterval
27.18 [c]29.62 [c]1s
```

This program uses the mode where the LED is either off or solid red.

### TEMPer1F

White plastic USB stick marked "TEMPer1F", "-40C - +125C"; with pink button
marked "TXT'. On the reverse, "PCsensor". This model has a jack for an
external sensor and does *not* have an internal sensor.

When the button is pressed, the red LED will blink as messages
of the following form are sent (the temperature line repeats every 1
second).

Without the probe inserted:
```
www.pcsensor.com
temperx v3.3
caps lock:on/off/++
num lock:off/on/--
type:unknown
1s
```

With the probe inserted:
```
www.pcsensor.com
temperx v3.3
caps lock:on/off/++
num lock:off/on/--
type:outer-tx
outer-tempinterval
24.93 [c]1s
```

This program uses the mode where the LED is either off or solid red.

### TEMPerX232

White plastic USB stick marked "TEMPerX232", "0-100%RH",
and "-40 - +85C"; with a *green button* marked "press". On the reverse,
"PCsensor". On the end opposite the USB connector, there is a jack for an
external temperature sensor (which I do not have and did not try).

When the button is pressed and held down until the red LED is solid, a blue
LED will flash every second. In this mode, the USB vendor:product changes to
413d:2107, but only one HID device is available, and protocol sent to the
hidraw device is rejected with an error.

When the LED is flashing blue, and the button is pressed momentarily,
the following are sent (the temperature line repeats every second).

```
www.PCsensor.com
TEMPerX232-V2.0
type:inner-H2
inner-temperinner-humidityinterval
30.48 [C]40.19 [%RH]1
```

When the button is pressed and held down until the red LED is solid, a green
LED will flash every second. This is the mode temper.py uses. In this mode, if
"Help" is sent to the serial device, the following will be sent back:

```

```

This is the mode that temper.py uses. I was not successful getting this device
to respond to any commands sent via the HID device.

I initially had trouble getting a reply to ReadTemp when using a terminal
program (e.g., cu), but the example in the temper.py works without any
problems, perhaps because no newline is sent after the command.

## Example Command Output

### Help

```
$ ./temper.py --help
usage: temper.py [-h] [-l] [--json] [--force VENDOR_ID:PRODUCT_ID]

temper

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-l, --list            List all USB devices
--json                Provide output as JSON
--force VENDOR_ID:PRODUCT_ID
                      Force the use of the hex id; ignore other ids
```

### List Devices

In this example, one of the devices doesn't have the HID driver attached
because I was using an libusb-based program to access it.

```
$ ./temper.py -l
Bus 001 Dev 023 413d:2107 * ??? ['hidraw0', 'hidraw1']
Bus 001 Dev 086 0c45:7401 * TEMPerV1.4 []
Bus 002 Dev 002 04d8:f5fe   TrueRNG ['ttyACM0']
```

### Temperature

In this example, one of the devices doesn't have the HID driver attached
because I was using an libusb-based program to access it.

```
$ ./temper.py
